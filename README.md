# BikeRides4U types

Shared type definitions for BR4U frontend and backend

## Usage

These type definitions can be included in a project as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

Add this submodule to the project, set `--esModuleInterop` to true in the project's `tsconfig.json` file, and import as you would any other ES6 module.

```JavaScript
  import { BikeRides4UEvent } from '<path to submodule>/br4u';
```
